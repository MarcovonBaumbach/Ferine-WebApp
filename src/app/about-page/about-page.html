        <h2>Forged in Fire, Fueled by Desire</h2>
        <p>
            Ferine started back in 2018 with one simple goal: to make music that comes from a burning soul and feels
            alive.
            We play alternative rock, but you’ll hear hints of grunge, punk, and hard rock in everything we do. <br><br>

            You'll experience our songs raw, loud and full of emotion, but also threaded with softer,
            melodic passages, carrying smoother, atmospheric sections — only to surge back into raw, driving intensity.
            Ferine is about raw feeling, relentless drive, and songs that stick with you long after the lights fade out.
